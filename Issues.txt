1. The GeneDrugRelation struct cannot be made public because, it gives a stack too deep error. This error is because, the compiler tries to make a function that will return the scaler variables in the struct, and here you run into stack limitation.

Solution: Declare the array as a local variable by removing public and create getter functions to retrieve the struct data.



2. query function returns an array of structs
it also has the keyword "view" as a modifier to the function. This means that the function cannot change the state of the contract.
Therefore, a dynamic array of struct needs to be declared inside the function inside the temporary memory. 

One cannot push to the array since its in the memory. 

If one tries to assign values to each and every variable inside the 1st element of the array of struct, it causes a runtime error and evm reverts the transaction. 

Thus, not using view.
