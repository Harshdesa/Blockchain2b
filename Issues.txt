1. The GeneDrugRelation struct cannot be made public because, it gives a stack too deep error. This error is because, the compiler tries to make a function that will return the scaler variables in the struct, and here you run into stack limitation.

Solution: Declare the array as a local variable by removing public and create getter functions to retrieve the struct data.
